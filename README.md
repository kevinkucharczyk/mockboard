# Mockboard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevinkucharczyk/mockboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevinkucharczyk/mockboard)

This is a mockup frontend for a widget-driven dashboard written in Ember.js. It is very much a work in progress.

The aim is to create an easily customizable dashboard with the ability to add and edit many types of widgets.
In future this project will probably also receive a backend to tie it all together and make it actually work. For now it remains a simple frontend.
